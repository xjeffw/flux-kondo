  "Relay Lisp, the language of `.rly` files: where it differs from Clojure.

  A Relay file is analyzed as Clojure (`:lang :clj`) with `:relay?` set in the
  ctx and in each namespace it declares. The differences:

  - Every namespace refers the public vars of `relay.core` and `relay.builtins`,
    as if by `(:use relay.core relay.builtins)`, minus the names its
    `:refer-clojure` clause excludes. These two namespaces take the place of
    `clojure.core`: an unqualified name is a var of them or it does not resolve.
    Relay declares its special forms as vars of `relay.core` too.
  - A qualified name resolves in any loaded namespace, required or not.
  - `^:private` keeps a var out of what other namespaces refer implicitly, and
    nothing else.
  - The error type of a `catch` clause is a name that is never evaluated.
  - A string keeps an escape the reader does not know, backslash included.
  - A vector is called with an index and, optionally, a default.
  - conj! and its like change their collection in place.
  - A file is named after its namespace as written, hyphens included, and a
    package keeps the namespace `P.tests.X` in `test/P/X.rly`. A `package.rly`
    is the description of a package: data, not code.
  - A macro says which of its arguments names the var it defines, in its
    `:definition-symbol` metadata."
